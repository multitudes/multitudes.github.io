My Website made with Publish.

[https://multitudes.github.io](https://multitudes.github.io)

I have been hosting my personal blog and website on my Github for quite some time, and when I heard that John Sundell announced his [`Publish`](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) framework to make static webpage with Swift I was intrigued. 

I made and customised my website now entirely using Swift built as a package in Xcode on my mac locally and then synced to GitHub pages.
