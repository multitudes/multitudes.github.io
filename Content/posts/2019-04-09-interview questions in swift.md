# bounds vs frame
difference is 
the frame is the position relative to its parent the super view. 
ex we have a UIView and the distance to the top is 102 and the distance to the side is 44 , with a width of 244 and height of 200. thats the frame
the bounds is measured within this views own coordinate system
