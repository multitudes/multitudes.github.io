## Accuracy of Floating Point Arithmetic

The fact that floating-point numbers cannot precisely represent all real numbers, and that floating-point operations cannot precisely represent true arithmetic operations, leads to many surprising situations. This is related to the finite precision with which computers generally represent numbers.

Exercise:
This example is taken from page 107 of *Numerical Methods*, by Greenbaum and Chartier.

Take a moment to look at the function $$f$$ below.  

{% highlight python %}

def f(x):
    if x <= 1/2:
        return 2 * x
    if x > 1/2:
        return 2*x - 1

{% endhighlight %}

Before you try running it, write on paper what the output would be of 

$$x_1 = f(\frac{1}{10})$$ 

Now, (still on paper) plug that back into $$f$$ and calculate 
$$x_2 = f(x_1)$$.  
Keep going for 10 iterations.

We probably managed to get this results:

`0.1`,`0.2`,`0.4`,`0.8`,`0.2`,`0.4`,`0.8`,`0.2`,`0.4`,`etc`

Now let the computer calculate this for us:

{% highlight python %}
x = 1/10
for i in range(80):
    print(x)
    x = f(x)
    
{% endhighlight %}    

What would you expect? a loop of the values we have on paper for around 80 lines on screen..?
Unfortunatly we get quickly this instead!

`0.1`
`0.2`
`0.4`
`0.8`
`...`
`0.40625`
`0.8125`
`0.625`
`0.25`
`0.5`
`1.0`
`1.0`
`1.0`
`...`

{% highlight C %}
#...
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    float x = 2;
    float y = 10;
    printf("x/y = %.50f\n",x/y);
}

{% endhighlight %} 

The output will be unfortunately:
`x/y = 0.20000000298023223876953125000000000000000000000000`

What went wrong?

To understand accuracy, we first need to look at how computers (which are finite and discrete) store numbers (which are infinite and continuous)


#### Problem: math is continuous & infinite, but computers are discrete & finite

Two Limitations of computer representations of numbers:
1. they can't be arbitrarily large or small
2. there must be gaps between them

The reason we need to care about accuracy, is because computers can't store infinitely accurate numbers.  It's possible to create calculations that give very wrong answers (particularly when repeating an operation many times, since each operation could multiply the error).

**Machine Epsilon**

Machine epsilon gives an upper bound on the relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic. 

It is also defined as half the distance between 1 and the next larger number. This can vary by computer.  IEEE standards for double precision specify $$ \varepsilon_{machine} = 2^{-53} \approx 1.11 \times 10^{-16}$$

### Expensive Errors

The below examples are from Greenbaum & Chartier.

The European Space Agency spent 10 years and $7 billion on the Ariane 5 Rocket which exploded 37 seconds after [launch](https://youtu.be/PK_yguLapgA). This is what can happen when you try to fit a 64 bit number into a 16 bit space (integer overflow):

Here is a floating point error that cost Intel $475 million:
