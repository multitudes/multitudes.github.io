This is the result of a one week school project, part of an introduction to C++ and object oriented programming
</div>

When I was looking for a theme for this project I came across this very entertaining blog called [codings horrors](https://blog.codinghorror.com) written by Jeff Atwood. He co-founded the website [Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) and wrote two books about coding and being awesome..
I read his post about the [history of Wumpus](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-history-of-wumpus/) and this gave me the idea to rewrite the Wumpus game for C++. It is a game written in 1972 for BASIC and with text output on a console. Since it would take more time to get a working GUI in C++ for an application, I decided that having a program with console output was perfect for my project.
The code is on my [GitHub Repository]()

The cource code needs to be compiled first. It has been debugged on a mac. In Windows there are minor changes needed to make it work because the console is controlled by the system and it is different on that platform.

To see the code or play the game download the repository, click on the file with extension xcodeproj and this will load the project in apple's Xcode.
