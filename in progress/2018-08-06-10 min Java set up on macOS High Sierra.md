#### Create a Java Project

#### Create the class
The next step is to create a new class. In the main toolbar again, click on the "New Java Class" button (or the link below). If not already specified, select 'HelloWorld/src' as the source folder. Enter HelloWorld for the class name, select the checkbox to create the main() method, then click Finish.
The Java editor will automatically open showing your new class.

#### Add a print statement
Now that you have your HelloWorld class, in the main() method, add the following statement:
{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello world!");
{% endhighlight %}
Then save your changes; the class will automatically compile 
upon saving.

#### Run the application
To run your application, right-click on your class in the Package Explorer and select Run As > Java Application or press command-fn-f11 on a mac notebook. 
The Console view should appear at the bottom and display the "Hello, world!" output.
