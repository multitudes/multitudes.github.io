For developers in a hurry. The quickest way to publish your blog and get it up and running 
</div>

A great inspiration recently has been a course about Machine and Deep Learning from Jeremy Howard at the San Francisco University, currently free to follow as a MOOC on the [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) website. One of the things Jeremy said remained with me. He recommended to the students: 'Start a blog about the things you are learning even if you think you are not quite there yet, it does'nt matter. Writing will be of great help to understand the study material better, and it is a great exercise to prcactice technical writing.'

So this is one thing which motivated me to start a blog and not just have a profile page. I gave myselt three days time to get this blog started. Started last Friday morning and by Friday midday I had it already online and spent another two hours looking at different fonts. It means it took me two hours max to get the template uploaded and working! It is so fast to get going and I will explain how in this tutorial. Not everything went smoothly though. This theme has been released in 2013 and since then a few things have changed which broke the [Hyde and Poole](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. I will show you everything you need to know to get that theme up and running in 2019 in this short tutorial.

I am working on a macBook with High Sierra and I use a terminal. Windows users might need a different approach or they can try to download [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org) for windows 

Why Jekyll? I wanted a blog which is customisable, and quick to get started. And Jekyll is free. It has also support for syntax highlighting which is great for coders and a number of other advantages, like supporting markdown which I love. It is such a perfect markup language for writing on the web.
oh, another inspiration for this blog has been [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net), he invented markdown by the way... but lets get started with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)! 

### Create a GitHub account
You need to create an account with GitHub. Git is one essential tool for developers so if you dont have an account yet head over to [GitHub](https://github.com) com and create an account.

Create an empty repository with the same name as your github profile handle, (for ex, mine is "multitudes.github.io" ) and keep it on master. Clone or download the new repo to your mac or pc. It will be empty but with a hidden file .git which is the file keeping track of your versions.

### Jekyll

Github natively support the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) plattform and will host one static website for you at no cost. Jekyll has templates and themes. you can see here some [examples](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/).

Clone or download the theme to your computer. Copy all the files minus the `.git` hidden file to your previously downloaded repo.
If you donâ€™t see hidden files and directories, or those that begin with a `.`, press `Command` `+` `SHIFT` `+` `.` (the last one is a dot)

### Push

Now it is the time to push the changes to your github account.

{% highlight bash %}

cd multitudes.github.io  # Go to your folder in terminal
git add -A               # Add everything you changed to the staging area
git status               # check status    
git commit -m "first commit"        # commit with a short message 
git push -u origin master           # push your changes to GitHub

{% endhighlight %}

Go to your page and check the result. You should see the template with the default theme for .

### Troubleshoot CSS

I choose the Hyde and Poole [Hyde and Poole](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme because frankly I wanted something like the fastai website and it looks similar and quite simple.

However this theme is already a few years old and doesnt work out of the box anymore. No worries, only a few changes were necessary.

I will list them here. 
- edit the file `CNAME` and delete its contents. Save.
- edit your `.yml` config file and replace the `highlighter : pigments` with `highlighter : rouge`. Like this:
{% highlight bash %}
highlighter:      rouge
{% endhighlight %}
- replace the URL line with your URL
- comment out the line: "markdown:         redcarpet"

To comment it out set a '#' at the beginning of the line.

Then eventually the landing page will work but the about me site has no styling! We need to edit the CSS file and the head file as follows:

Replace the all instances of `{% raw %}{{ base_url }}{% endraw %}` in the `head.html` file in the `_includes` folder with `{% raw %}{{ '/' | relative_url }}{% endraw %}` and do the same in the `sidebar.html`. 
This is because of an issue caused by a git hub upgrade that broke this theme a while ago. 
[From this page](https://github.com/poole/hyde/issues/213) look at the third post from the top.

push the changes done locally on your github account. for this 
open your terminal and repeat as in step 4

## Links and Pagination check

Need to check that the links are working. We Look at the folders posts.
The Jekyll pages are auto generated from those files. There is a certain format we need to keep. The title has to start with the date, followed by the name.. like this example:
2012-02-06-whats-jekyll.md
md is the markdown extension. You can read more about markdown [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and there are different flavours, but it is really easy to get started.
I would start to duplicate the existing post files with `Command-d` (on a mac) and edit it in your code editor (it is a markdown file). You can use your favourite editor or use brackets [Brackets](http://brackets.io), which is free. The first few lines enclosed in `---` have to be present in every post. We change the title of course.

We add pictures with

{% highlight yml %}

[image-title-here](/path/to/image.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

{% endhighlight %}
push the changes and see your first post on your new website!!


## Customize 

This theme is customisable however the optional color schemes as described in the documentation did not work for me. I think it is best to just modify the CSS files and add some HTML in the template. Fonts can be modified easily for instance I changed the font of the main title and the blog to the system fonts.  

## Optional but recommended

Optional. You can set up a development environment for Jekyll on your computer. The necessary files and downloads are on their website, however expect to spend some time debugging various issues. It is just fine to edit posts and push them to github an see the results there, but it can a bit risky, because the results will be immediately for all to see. 

## Published posts and drafts 

keep the draft of the post in the same folder, just add unpublished to the header above as follows:

{% highlight yml %}
published: false
{% endhighlight %}
The post will be unvisible until this will be changed to `published`, or removed.

## MathJax support 

To get MathJax support, add the lines to your theme layouts:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Mathjax Support -->
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

either just before the `</head>` tag in your theme file, or at the end of the file if it contains no `</head>`.

As for my site, you can find the above lines in /_includes/head.html.

## Bonus: How to do a pull request.

We found some bugs and some outdated code. We will do a pull request.
Go to the repository. In thia example I will go to the Hyde[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme
On the top right I will click on fork to save a copy in my repository.
I will start by copying the link on my clipboard an will open my terminal to download it locally.

{% highlight bash %}

git clone https://github.com/multitudes/hyde.git

cd hyde/            # I am going to the downloaded folder

ls                  # list all files

open _config.yml    # open the config file in my editor


{% endhighlight %}

I remove the line: `relative_permalinks: true` 
This setting is deprecated as has been removed from the latest version of Jekyll.

It would give me an error message if I keep it.

I will now push the change to my copy of Hyde which had been forked.
The "origin" is the place where the code originates from, so it is the remote repository on github, my fork copy. then I specify master which is the branch. In this case it was expressely requested from the source to submit pull requests to master..

{% highlight bash %}
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

We go back to the GitHub website.
Click new pull request
Click on compare across forks. Need to select my repo and then click on pull request button.
Now it is up to the developer to reply or accept our changes and merge the two repos.
I can see on his page that I am not the only one who asked for changes and the requests are mostly unanswered! Anyway it is good practice!

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Please see how to create a bash script to push your commits to github if you want to optimize your workflow.
