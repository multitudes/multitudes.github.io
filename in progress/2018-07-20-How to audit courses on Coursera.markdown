This is a small but important tutorial. I am sometimes surprised how many people don't know this simple trick to audit a course at coursera.
</div>


For this example lets go to the Coursera website and look for a course about deep learning

![coursera](/assets/img/coursera0.png)

we found this page listing 5 courses:

* [Coursera: Deep Learning specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Lets click on acourse. Assuming that we have already logged in, we get this window:

There is of course no mention about auditing the course.. we will need to change tactic and look for the page of the course in search instead of going through the specialisation menu. Let's find this course again.. Here it is!

Input the name of the course in search and click on enroll. Now you will see the link "audit" the course on the bottom left.

Auditing the course gives access to all videos, is self paced and does'nt give access to some homework and assigments. 
Of course you will not get a certificate auditing but it is a great introduction to topics that interest you. 
I found Coursera to be a great platform for learning.

That's it for now. If I missed something let me know in the comments!
